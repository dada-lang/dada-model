//! # Subpermission
//!
//! All operations permitted by supertype must be permitted by the subtype.
//!
//! C1. This begins with edits on the data structure itself, so `our Foo` cannot be a subtype of `my Foo`
//! since the latter permits field mutation.
//!
//! C2. This also includes restrictions on what can be done in the environment. So `shared[d1] Foo` cannot
//! be a subtype of `shared[d2] Foo` since the latter permits `d1` to be modified but the subtype does not.
//! (The latter also restricts edits to `d2`, but that's ok in the supertype, it can be more restrictive.)
