;; terminate-leave program env lease-kind place -> env
;;
;; Removes any places from the list of "definitely initialized"
;; places whose types may reference (lease-kind place).
;;
;; This is used after place is accessed, and the lease-kind
;; is the kind of lease that is invalidated by that access.
;; So, for example, if we have a read of `x`, then we would
;; remove all places that have a type like that references
;; `borrowed x`.
;;
;; Note that these places remain in the 'maybe initialized'
;; list, which permits them to be dropped. This is ok because
;; dropping something of "shared/borrowed" mode has no effect.
;;
;; FIXME: For now, we just remove the entire place from
;; being considered initialized. At some point we might replace
;; it with more refined paths that are unaffected.
