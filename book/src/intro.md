# Dada Formal Model

Documents the formal model. Aspires to be a tour of the codebase, a kind of "literate programming"-style document. But for now, mostly a place for me to add notes.

## Formality core

The model is implemented in [formality-core](https://rust-lang.github.io/a-mir-formality/formality_core.html), the system defined for [a-mir-formality](https://rust-lang.github.io/a-mir-formality/). Snippets of the grammar are typically taken from [`src/grammar.rs`](https://github.com/dada-lang/dada-model/blob/main/src/grammar.rs).
