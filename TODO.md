Notes to myself about possible next steps:

- [x] add some basic tests for share/lease
- [x] incorporate liveness
- [ ] add structs/value types
- [ ] convert Int to a value type (we'll have to fix some of the move tests)
- [x] tests for giving a shared value (I think it'll do the wrong thing now!)
- [x] tests for giving a leased value
