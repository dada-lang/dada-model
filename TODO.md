Notes to myself about possible next steps:

- [ ] add some basic tests for share/lease
- [ ] add structs/value types
- [ ] convert Int to a value type (we'll have to fix some of the move tests)
- [ ] tests for giving a shared value (I think it'll do the wrong thing now!)
- [ ] tests for giving a leased value
